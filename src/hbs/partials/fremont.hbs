                <p>Our local 900 patron venue, The Fremont Theater, has granted us access to encourage your show to have a Sneaky’s date along with a large theater show. This isn’t mandatory, but if you would like to get 2 shows back to back, we can make it happen. We’d love to discuss details when you’re ready to get 2 great shows dialed.</p>
